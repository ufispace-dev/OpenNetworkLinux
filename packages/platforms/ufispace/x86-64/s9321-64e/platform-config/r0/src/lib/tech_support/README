[How to build] (Optional. If the original binary file encounters execution errors,
                you can rebuild it by yourself.)
    [Command]:
        gcc -o fpga_port_eeprom.bin fpga_port_eeprom.c -Wall

[How to run]
    1) Run tech support script to collect the logs.
       [Command]:
           ./show_platform_log.sh

       [Output]:
           The script will take a few minutes, please wait...

[Remark]
    1) To collect logs efficiently, you can execute a tech support script designed for this purpose.
    These scripts are programmed to gather various system information, log files, and command outputs
    into a single file for analysis and troubleshooting.
    2) The fpga_port_eeprom.c file contains sample code for retrieving port EEPROM data via FPGA I2C.
    If the original binary file encounters execution errors, you have the capability to rebuild it by yourself.
